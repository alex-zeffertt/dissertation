Run ./NorthJutlandPopDensity.py to create some population density data for North Jutland.
Result is the file

       ./NorthJutlandPopDensityGridded.pickle

which contains a tuple of 3 1000x1000 numpy arrays

     (x_grid, y_grid, z_grid)

the first is longitude in degrees, the second is latitude in degrees, the third
is population density in people per km2.

Pre-requisites:

The file ../NorthJutlandBoundary/NorthJutlandBoundary.pickle must exist first,
See ../NorthJutlandBoundary/README


Visualization
-------------

Run ./graph.py after creating ./NorthJutlandPopDensityGridded.pickle to visualize
using matplotlib
