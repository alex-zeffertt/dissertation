Loosely based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts%E2%80%93Strogatz_model
but with changes to support pre-figured 2-D population density and
making geographically close people more likely to form ties.

Run NorthJutlandSocialGraph.py with two parameters to build a social graph, e.g.

    ./NorthJutlandSocialGraph.py 4 1.5

The first is the average number of weak ties each person has (identified as
people with whom each person eats on a regular basis).  The number of
weak ties is modelled by a Poisson distribution with this mean.

The second parameter indicates how geographically close weak ties are in km.
Specifically the probability of a weak tie between two individuals is
taken to be proportional to the value of a normal distribution with
this s.d..

----- Outputs -------

The script creates the file

    ./NorthJutlandSocialGraph_<arg0>_<arg1>.pickle

The idea is to create a number of these files in with different
arguments in advance because creation of these social graphs is a slow
process.  This will allow effects found later on when the CA is run to
be parametized efficiently.

----- Prerequisites ------

The script requires that

    ../NorthJutlandPopDensity/NorthJutlandPopDensityGridded.pickle

already exists.  See ../NorthJutlandPopDensity/README for details on
how to create this.
