Run ./CAModel to evolve the state over a bunch of timesteps, e.g.

    ./NorthJutlandSocialGraph.py \
          <mean_n_weak_ties> \
          <modal_weak_tie_km> \
          <awareness_pc> \
          <facility_pc> \
          <p_update_logit_normal_sigma> \
          <n_timesteps>
     
If fewer params are given then defaults are used for the unset arguments at the
end:

          <mean_n_weak_ties> : default 6 : average number of weak ties per person
          <modal_weak_tie_km> : default 1.0 : modal distance of a weak tie
          <awareness_pc> : default 30 : percent of those initially without ties
                                        intending to or actively meat reducing
          <facility_pc> : default 33.3 : percent of those initially without ties
                                         and intending to or actively meat
                                         reducing who are meat reducing.
          <p_update_logit_normal_sigma> : default 0.5 : std deviation of logit(p)
                                       where p is an individual's likelihood of
                                       doing a random update each timestep.
                                       (mean is fixed at 0.5).  The distribution
                                       switches from modal to bimodal at around
                                       sigma = 1.5
          <n_timesteps> : default 20 : number of timesteps.  These are nominally
                                      6 months, but in fact determined by the
                                      fact the distribution above has mean 0.5

----- Outputs -------

Creates a bunch of graphs at the moment.
TODO create some maps

Preliminary investigation suggests that

1) the output converges quite quickly (< 10 timesteps) independently of values
   used (as long as they're reasonable)

2) the ratios in each stage of change coverge stabily

3) the limits of convergence change smoothly as you change each of the first 5
   parameters

4) no appearance of any avalanche effect, as such

----- Prerequisites ------

The script requires that

    ../NorthJutlandSocialGraph/NorthJutlandSocial_Graph_<mean_n_weak_ties>_<modal_weak_tie_km>.pickle

already exists.  See ../NorthJutlandPopDensity/README for details on
how to create this.
